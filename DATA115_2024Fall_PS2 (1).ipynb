   "\n",
    "A bar chart is a graph representing the quantities of unique variables in a dataset, while a histogram represents a single variable's quantities over a specific measurement. For example, a bar chart can represent the populations in different cities in New York, while a Histogram can display how one of them has changed over a range of years.\n",

    "The mean is the average of the numbers in a dataset (adding all of the numbers and dividing by the amount of them), and the median is the exact middle value. For example, in a set (1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 17), the mean is 6.44... and the median is 5.\n",
